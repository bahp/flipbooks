# flipbooks

Bookshelf with flipbooks and pdfs.

## Adding a flipbook

First, create the flipbook and save it in its corresponding folder. The flipbooks
can be created using commercial software such as Flip PDF Professional or the free 
turn.js javascript library. 

Update the corresponding bookshelves index file.

The main `index.html` file just redirects to the corresponding bookshelf.
